# MS-MS-Spectrum-Analysis-
This MS/MS Viewer project visualizes peptide fragmentation spectra from mzXML files. It takes an mzXML file, scan number, and peptide sequence as input, computes b-ion and y-ion m/z values, and annotates matching peaks. The plot helps assess peptide-spectrum matches, aiding in accurate peptide identification and analysis.
